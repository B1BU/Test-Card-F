# Test Card F Recreation

This repository contains my attempt at a high-quality recreation of BBC's [Test Card F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Card_F), made using [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com). I created this because I wanted to use the image for a gag on my livestreams but couldn't find a decent high-quality version online.

I took a few creative liberties with my recreation so it looks more visually pleasing, like extending the side bars to align with the edges of the frame and the top and bottom bars to cover the line of dashes.

This project was inspired by [edent](https://github.com/edent)'s [SVG Test Cards](https://github.com/edent/SVGtestcard).

## Notes

- Colors are guesstimates, as I couldn't color pick any images due to compression. If you know the correct ones, please let me know.
- The PSD file isn't great, as I wasn't originally planning to post this online, but I felt other people could find it useful considering I was looking for this myself.
- Sorry for the bad repo, I am very new to this.

## Usage

Feel free to use this recreation however you like. Credit isn't required, but would be appreciated when sharing or using it publicly.
