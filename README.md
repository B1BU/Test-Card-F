# Test Card F Recreation

This repository contains my attempt at a high-quality recreation of BBC's [Test Card F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Card_F), made using [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com). I created this because I wanted to use the image for a gag on my livestreams but couldn't find a decent high-quality version online.

This project was inspired by [edent](https://github.com/edent)'s [SVG Test Cards](https://github.com/edent/SVGtestcard).

## Notes

- I took a few creative liberties with my recreation so it looks more visually pleasing, like extending the top and bottom bars over the line of dashes and extending the right bar to align with the edges of the frame.
- Some colors may be slightly off.
- The PSD file isn't great, as I wasn't originally planning to post this online, but I felt other people could find it useful considering I was looking for this myself.
- Sorry for the bad repo, I am still learning how this whole thing works.

## Usage

Feel free to use this recreation however you like. Credit isn't required, but would be appreciated when sharing or using it publicly.
