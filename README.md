# Test Card X Recreation

This repository contains my attempt at a recreation of the high-definition variant of BBC's [Test Card W](https://testcard.fandom.com/wiki/Test_Card_W) (popularly referred to as [Test Card X](https://testcard.fandom.com/wiki/Test_Card_X)), made using [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com). I created this because I wanted to use the image for a gag on my livestreams but couldn't find a decent high-definition version online.

I took a few creative liberties with my recreation so it looks more visually pleasing, like extending the side bars to align with the edges of the frame and the top and bottom bars to cover the line of dashes.

This project was inspired by [edent](https://github.com/edent)'s [SVG Test Cards](https://github.com/edent/SVGtestcard).

## Notes

- Colors are guesstimates, as I couldn't color pick any images accurately due to compression. If you know the correct ones or how to identify them, please let me know.
- The PSD file isn't great, as I wasn't originally planning to post this online, but I'm currently working on a better version that's easier to customize.
- Sorry for the bad repo, I don't have a lot of experience posting stuff like this online.

## Usage

Feel free to use this recreation however you like. Credit isn't required, but would be appreciated when sharing or using it publicly.
